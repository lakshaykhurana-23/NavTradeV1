##### Definitions of Manufacturing Operations

Tanning – Tanning with one or more than one kind of tanning agent, t, such as mineral tanning and vegetable tanning and / or syntan tanning and/ or resin tanning and/or aldehyde tanning , oil tanning in any sequence and or any new type of tanning .

Dyeing – Treating the leather with a solution of dye/s to impart a colour. r. In case of doubt the presence of dye should be ascertained by extracting dye from leather using suitable solvent mixture and by running thin layer chromatography (TLC)

Note: 1: -Testing for the presence of dye:

Organic layer separated from Butanol, l, acetic acid and water mixture taken in the ratio 4: 1: 5 , using a separating funnel is taken as the eluting solvent for TLC analysis .

Dye is extracted from the leather using dichloromethane and methanol (1: 1) mixture . The cut pieces of leathers are heated in a water bath with the solvent mixture for few miniutes . The extracted dye is kept as a spot on the TLC paper and the strip is kept in the eluting solvent such that the dye spot lies above the solvent level . The presence of the dye is confirmed by its movement to a considerable distance and from the formation of a dye curve or peak on the TLC paper. r.

Fatliquoring – Treating the leather with oil and/or fat, t, emulsified in water for rendering the leather soft

Finishing Coat – Finishing coat shall contain a film forming material/ binder in combination with colorants such as pigments or dyes or a combination of both . The film forming material/binder shall comprise materials singly or in combination such as proteins or synthetic acrylic or polyurethane , vinyls lacquers or lacquer emulsions .

If necessary, y, microscopic examination of the surface at minimum 100 times magnification shall be carried out to detect the finishing coat .

Note 2: -Microscopic examination for finish coat:

Binocular stereoscopic microscope with (two paired) objectives capable of viewing the objects at a total magnification of 100X will be required . Stereoscopic microscope gives a three dimensional view of the object .

Leather sample to be examined is placed on the stage of the microscope with the grain facing the objectives and then the surface is focused . Two or three places in each of the five locations namely butt, t, belly (one each side of the back bone line) and neck or shoulder examined .

To the naked eye , the grain surface may appear to be plain , but when focused under microscope , innumerable depressions can be seen on the surface . These depressions are due to cleavages lines and hair pores . If finish coat is sprayed on the grain surface , it will be present throughout, t, including depressed areas and both the depressed and other areas will produce the same type of reflection which is clearly visible under the microscope .

Buffing – An operation to produce a clean flesh surface to produce nap on leather by the action of emery wheel or a buffing machine

Shaving – A mechanical operation of reducing the substance of leather to uniform thickness by scrapping off layers from flesh or grain side

Snuffing – The process of buffing the grain side of leather usually done by buffing machine , with visible evidence of removal of grain

Oiling – The operation of rubbing oil on the grain side of wet or sammed leather with the object of making the leather soft and pliable; in the case of vegetable tanned leather also to protect the color of tannage from darkening by oxidation .

Wax coat – Wax particulate matter should be seen under Microscope (100x) after the application of xylene on the grain surface .

Note 3: -Microscopic examination of wax coat:

A small drop of xylene is placed on the surface of the leather. r. The surface is scrapped gently using a glass rod . Leather is left for 2 -3 minutes . The dried leather surface is observed under microscope for the presence of wax crystals on the surface .

Burnishable Effect – Rubbing on grain surface of leather should show a distinct gloss with a darkening of the shade giving rise to a burnishing effect . Minimum CIE ∆L value of – 5 . 0 on 10 dry rubbing on SATRA or any other fastness tester

Pull up Effect – Leather shall produce a distinct pull-up effect showing a contrast light color from the base minimum CIE ∆L value of +5 as measured by the reflectance spectrophotometer. r.

Wool Combing– The operation through which wool entanglements are released .

Application of foil/film – Acrylic/ PVC/PU foil or film

Rolling – The operation of rolling the heavy leathers like sole leather using a heavy roller with rolling machine .
