## Project Statement Submission

### Lakshay Khurana 2203312 Bluno Technologies Pvt Ltd

During my internship, I am working on a full-stack enterprise web application with an integrated AI-based compliance assistant to support internal operational and trade workflows.

The project involves building a scalable and secure web platform for managing structured data and business processes. The frontend delivers a responsive user interface, while the backend, developed using Java and Spring Boot, handles business logic and RESTful APIs. A MySQL database is used for persistent storage with focus on performance and data integrity.

Alongside this, I am developing an AI-powered compliance agent using Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to simplify trade compliance by analyzing documents and answering user queries. The AI component is integrated into the web application to enhance existing workflows.

The project emphasizes clean architecture, maintainability, and industry best practices.
