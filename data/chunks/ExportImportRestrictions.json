In case of doubt the presence of dye should be ascertained by extracting dye from leather using suitable solvent mixture and by running thin layer chromatography (TLC)  \nNote: 1: -Testing for the presence of dye:  \nOrganic layer separated from Butanol, l, acetic acid and water mixture taken in the ratio 4: 1: 5 , using a separating funnel is taken as the eluting solvent for TLC analysis .  \nDye is extracted from the leather using dichloromethane and methanol (1: 1) mixture . The cut pieces of leathers are heated in a water bath with the solvent mixture for few miniutes . The extracted dye is kept as a spot on the TLC paper and the strip is kept in the eluting solvent such that the dye spot lies above the solvent level . The presence of the dye is confirmed by its movement to a considerable distance and from the formation of a dye curve or peak on the TLC paper. r.  \nFatliquoring – Treating the leather with oil and/or fat, t, emulsified in water for rendering the leather soft  \nFinishing Coat – Finishing coat shall contain a film forming material/ binder in combination with colorants such as pigments or dyes or a combination of both . The film forming material/binder shall comprise materials singly or in combination such as proteins or synthetic acrylic or polyurethane , vinyls lacquers or lacquer emulsions .  \nIf necessary, y, microscopic examination of the surface at minimum 100 times magnification shall be carried out to detect the finishing coat .  \nNote 2: -Microscopic examination for finish coat:  \nBinocular stereoscopic microscope with (two paired) objectives capable of viewing the objects at a total magnification of 100X will be required . Stereoscopic microscope gives a three dimensional view of the object .  \nLeather sample to be examined is placed on the stage of the microscope with the grain facing the objectives and then the surface is focused . Two or three places in each of the five locations namely butt, t, belly (one each side of the back bone line) and neck or shoulder examined .  \nTo the naked eye , the grain surface may appear to be plain , but when focused under microscope , innumerable depressions can be seen on the surface . These depressions are due to cleavages lines and hair pores . If finish coat is sprayed on the grain surface , it will be present throughout, t, including depressed areas and both the depressed and other areas will produce the same type of reflection which is clearly visible under the microscope .  \nBuffing – An operation to produce a clean flesh surface to produce nap on leather by the action of emery wheel or a buffing machine  \nShaving – A mechanical operation of reducing the substance of leather to uniform thickness by scrapping off layers from flesh or grain side  \nSnuffing – The process of buffing the grain side of leather usually done by buffing machine , with visible evidence of removal of grain  \nOiling – The operation of rubbing oil on the grain side of wet or sammed leather with the object of making the leather soft and pliable; in the case of vegetable tanned leather also to protect the color of tannage from darkening by oxidation .  \nWax coat – Wax particulate matter should be seen under Microscope (100x) after the application of xylene on the grain surface .  \nNote 3: -Microscopic examination of wax coat:  \nA small drop of xylene is placed on the surface of the leather. r. The surface is scrapped gently using a glass rod . Leather is left for 2 -3 minutes . The dried leather surface is observed under microscope for the presence of wax crystals on the surface .  \nBurnishable Effect – Rubbing on grain surface of leather should show a distinct gloss with a darkening of the shade giving rise to a burnishing effect . Minimum CIE ∆L value of – 5 . 0 on 10 dry rubbing on SATRA or any other fastness tester  \nPull up Effect – Leather shall produce a distinct pull-up effect showing a contrast light color from the base minimum CIE ∆L value of +5 as measured by the reflectance spectrophotometer. r.  \nWool Combing– The operation through which wool entanglements are released .  \nApplication of foil/film – Acrylic/ PVC/PU foil or film  \nRolling – The operation of rolling the heavy leathers like sole leather using a heavy roller with rolling machine .  \n2 .
